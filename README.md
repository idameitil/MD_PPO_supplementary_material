Supplementary material for MD study on PPOs

- Supplementary Video 1: Simulation of AoCO4 with guaiacol using CHARMM force fields (100 ns). The movement of the copper and peroxide atoms is due to errors in the settings used for removing the periodic boundary conditions.
- Supplementary Video 2: Simulation of AoCO4 with syringyl using CHARMM force fields (100 ns). The movement of the copper and peroxide atoms is due to errors in the settings used for removing the periodic boundary conditions.
- Supplementary Video 3: Simulation of AoCO4 without glycosylation and without ligands using AMBER force fields (220 ns).
- Supplementary Video 4: Simulation of AoCO4 with (blue) and without (green) glycosylation and without ligands using AMBER force fields and Gaussian model of the copper-histidine system (190 ns).
- Supplementary Video 5: Simulation of TtPPO with (blue) and without (green) glycosylation and without ligands using AMBER force fields and Gaussian model of the copper-histidine system (190 ns).
- Supplementary Video 6: Simulation of AoCO4 with glycosylation and with phenol using AMBER force fields and Gaussian model of the copper-histidine system (130 ns).
